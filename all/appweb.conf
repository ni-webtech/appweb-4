#   appweb.conf -- Configuration file for "ajsweb run"
#   
#   This configuration file is used by ajsweb. Don't confuse this config file
#   with the main appweb configuration file.
#
#   The order of configuration directives matters as this file is parsed only once.
#   You must put the server root and error log definitions first to ensure 
#   configuration errors are logged.
#

#
#   Define the logging configuration first so any errors are logged
#
<if LOG>
    #
    #   Log all Appweb errors and trace to this file. This is the error 
    #   file for the whole server including all virtual hosts. 
    #
    ErrorLog "error.log"

    #
    #   The log level can be a number between 0 and 9 (most verbose level).
    #
    LogLevel 2
</if>

<if ACCESS_LOG>
    #
    #   Define the log format for the access log.
    #
    #   CustomLog "access.log" "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b"

#   Root directory for Appweb to find necessary files and libraries. 
#   Appweb will change directory to this location when it runs.
#
#   ServerRoot "/usr/lib/ejs"

#
#   Bind Appweb to listen for incoming requests on this address. Formats 
#   include (IP, IP:PORT, PORT). If an IP address is omitted, Appweb will 
#   listen on all interfaces. If a port is omitted, then port 80 is used.
#   Use [::]:port for IPv6 to bind to all addresses. [::1] is the IPv6 loopback.

#
#   Name of the server to use for redirects and error responses to clients. 
#   Uncomment this line and replace it with the public name of your server. 
#   This host name and port do not get used for listening on sockets. If 
#   unspecified, Appweb will use the IP address for the host name.
#
#   ServerName http://localhost:9997

#   Location for documents for the primary server host. Virtual hosts 
#   may define their own DocumentRoot directives.
