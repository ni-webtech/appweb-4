            <h1>Multithreaded Programming</h1>
            <a name="overview"></a>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Programming in a multithreaded environment can be difficult. Sometimes programming errors are timing related 
            as multiple threads interact. Multithread locks can become tangled and bugs can be difficult to reproduce. 
            To alleviate these problems and
            enable the benefits of a multi-threaded core, Appweb provides a suite of facilities to make multithreaded
            programming easier, more reliable, and more efficient.</p>
            <h3>The Problem of Multithreaded I/O Events</h3>
            <p>A particular thorny issue in multithreaded servers, is how to handle I/O without consuming a thread for
            each request. It is not practical to dedicate a thread to each HTTP request. A single browser will often
            send 6-10 simultaneous requests. If each request consumed a thread for the duration, the web server would
            quickly consume too many threads and system performance would greatly suffer. </p>
            <p>One solution is to use a thread pool. This allows a request to borrow a thread from a thread pool while 
            the request is active and return the thread when it cannot immediately continue with servicing the request. 
            A thread may
            not be able to continue because it is waiting for I/O from the client, or waiting for I/O to the client to 
            drain over the network. Returning the thread to the pool allows other requests to use the thread while the
            first request is waiting for network I/O. When the network is ready, a thread can be obtained from the pool
            and the original request can continue. For this to work, an efficient network event service is 
            essential. Appweb uses such a thread pool and event service to efficiently manage thread resources. </p>
            
            <p>However, this use of such an event service and thread pool raises another problem: races between the 
            foreground request thread and the background async I/O event thread. It is easy for these two threads to 
            simultaneously interact and corrupt critical data structures. A typical solution is to use multithread
            locks to serialize access to such data, but this is a crude solution and often leads to brittle applications.
            Appweb has a better solution that effectively serializes all activity for a request: per-request 
            event dispatchers.</p>
            <a name="dispatchers"></a>
            <h3>Event Dispatchers</h3>
            <p>The Multithreaded Portable Runtime (MPR) used by Appweb has a facility called Event Dispatchers. These
            are event queues on which all I/O and other event activity for a request can be queued and serviced. 
            Each request has its own dispatcher and so events for a request are serialized.  When a network I/O event
            is received by Appweb for a request, an event is queued on the request's dispatcher. If the request is 
            currently active (using a thread from the thread pool), the event is queued and no further action is taken. 
            When the request has finished its current activity, it will service events on its dispatcher queue and 
            eventually service the I/O event. If the request is currently idle, a thread is assigned from the thread 
            pool for the request, and the thread is resumed to service the request's dispatcher queue. This greatly 
            simplifies Appweb as all activity for a request is thus serialized via the dispatcher queue.</p>
            <a name="multithreaded"></a>
            <h3>Multithreaded Appweb</h3>
            <p>By using request dispatchers, Appweb serializes all request activity, yet it can support many 
            simultaneous requests due to its multithreaded core. Appweb efficiently utilizes thread resources by using
            a thread pool and not dedicating threads permanently to requests. Threads are temporarily assigned
            only as required by active requests.</p>
            <a name="modules"></a>
            <h3>Modules</h3>
            <p>Appweb can be extended by writing loadable modules. Modules can add request handlers, pipeline filters,
            or network connectors. All module code can rely on the fact that request activity will be serialized and
            no locking is required to serialize I/O activity. Consequently, most module code can be effectively 
            single-threaded.</p>
            <p>Appweb can also be extended via Embedded Server Pages applications. These are loadable ESP web pages,
            and ESP Model-View-Controller applications. These too can rely on the fact that request activity is serialized
            and locking primitives are typically not required. ESP code can thus be simple, 
            single-threaded application code.</p>
            
            <a name="locking"></a>
            <h3>Locking</h3>
            <p>If you have a requirement for a data structure that will be accessed and manipulated simultaneously
            by multiple threads, the MPR provides a suite of locking primitives. See
            <a href="../../api/mpr.html#group___mpr_synch">MprSynch</a> for the MPR Multithreaded Synchronization Services.</p>
