            loadable modules, Apache style configuration file, PHP, Ejscript, CGI, sandbox resource limits, logging,
            angel monitoring process and extensive conditional configuration and compilation controls.</p>
            <p>With these features, Appweb is designed to make hosting and embedding web applications painless. Whether
            they are based on server-side JavaScript, PHP, Ruby or custom embedded device applications, Appweb is the
            perfect back-end to host your web application.</p>
            <h3>Deployed Widely</h3>
            <p>As one of the most widely deployed embedded web servers, Appweb is being used in networking equipment,
            telephony, mobile devices, consumer and office equipment as well as hosting for enterprise web applications
            and frameworks. It runs equally well stand-alone or in a farm behind a reverse proxy such as Apache. Appweb
            provides both Open-Source and commercial licenses and comes with full source code.</p><a name="components"
            id="components"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Components</h2>
            <p>Appweb provides the following components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTTP web server program and library</li>
                <li>HTTP client program and library</li>
                <li>Angel and monitor processes</li>
                <li>Support for the web frameworks: PHP and Ejscript</li>
                <li>Loadable modules for CGI, EGI, authentication, directory listings and file upload</li>
                <li>Secure Socket Layer (SSL/TLS)</li>
                <li>Complete documentation with samples</li>
                <li>Full source code</li>
            </ul><a name="goals" id="goals"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Goals and Non-Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of Appweb is to create the best web server for hosting web applications and frameworks whether
            they be embedded device applications or enterprise applications behind a reverse proxy. This requires that
            Appweb be:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Robust and secure</li>
                <li>Efficient with memory</li>
                <li>Fast with low latency</li>
                <li>Easy to configure and manage</li>
            </ol><a name="nonGoals" id="nonGoals"></a>
            <h3>Non Goals</h3><img src="../../images/scalable.jpg" alt="" class="wrapLeft" />
            <p>Appweb was specifically designed to handle small loads exceptionally well. An explicit goal was
            <b>NOT</b> to create a single, monolithic, highly scalable web server like Apache, that can handle
            thousands of simultaneous users. Note that Appweb will scale very well when used behind a <a href=
            "#proxy">reverse-proxy</a> such as Apache or Lighttpd.</p><a name="uses" id="uses"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Target Uses</h2><a name="embedded" id="embedded"></a>
            <h3>Embedded Device Applications</h3><img src="../../images/board.jpg" alt="" class="wrapRight" height=
            "150" width="150" />
            <p>When used in embedded devices or applications, web servers must assume they are secondary to the
            essential functions the device or application must perform. As such, the web server must minimize its
            resource demands and should be deterministic in the load it places on a system.</p>
            <p>Appweb excels in this regard and is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast and compact with a small memory footprint (from 800K).</li>
                <li>Easily embedded in applications and devices &mdash; via a one line API.</li>
                <li>Easy to configure and administer &mdash; via an Apache compatible configuration and extensive build
                time configuration options.</li>
                <li>Secure by design and by default.</li>
                <li>Minimal in its demand on system resources &mdash; via configurable resource limits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Appweb is the #1 <i>embedded</i> web server and has been successfully deployed in <a href=
            "http://www.appwebserver.org/products/appweb/users.html">millions of devices</a> and embedded
            applications.</p><a name="proxy" id="proxy"></a>
            <h3>Web Applications Behind Reverse Proxies</h3>
            <p>Ruby and PHP have transformed the landscape for developing web 2.0 applications. They have made many
            tasks easier, but deploying these applications has not been quite so smooth. The "dirty-little-secret"
            about using these web frameworks is &mdash; deployment is messy and difficult.</p>
            <p>CGI, FastCGI, Mongrel-Clusters ... many solutions have been tried. More recently, the best solution is
            emerging &mdash; to deploy these applications behind a reverse proxy. This permits the front-end web server
            to exclusively serve static content and route the incoming requests. The back-end can then focus on
            actually running the application.</p>
            <p><img src="../../images/proxied.jpg" alt="" /></p>
            <p>Appweb is an ideal back-end web server in this scenario for running web applications. Because Appweb is
            a fast, multi-threaded, event driven server, each Appweb instance can host several web application sessions
            for maximum efficiency and minimal memory footprint. Due to its Apache compatible configuration file, you
            don't have to learn a whole new configuration setup. Using this configuration, you will lighten the load on
            your web installation, provide better response to clients and simplify your configuration.</p><a name=
            "internals" id="internals"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Appweb Internals</h2>
            <p>The core of Appweb is an event-driven, multi-threaded HTTP pipeline above which modules are loaded to
            provide content specific handling and to extend its functionality.</p>
            <p><img src="../../images/modules.jpg" alt="" /></p>
            <p>Appweb has the following feaures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High performance multi-threaded core.</li>
                <li>Modular architecture with dynamic module loading.</li>
                <li>Request oriented memory allocator for fast allocations and to eliminate memory leaks.</li>
                <li>Portable runtime layer to isolate platform dependencies.</li>
                <li>Sandboxing to limit resource consumption for more robust operation.</li>
                <li>Safe programming layer to prevent buffer overrun exploits.</li>
                <li>Apache compatible configuration.</li>
                <li>Extensive logging and debug trace.</li>
            </ul><a name="pipeline" id="pipeline"></a>
            <h3>Request Pipeline</h3>
            <p>Appweb has an efficient, zero-copy request bi-directional pipeline to process requests and generate
            responses. This consists of a mechanism of queues, packets, buffering and event scheduling. The pipeline
            architecture is highly optimized and supports the efficient transmission of data without copying. It uses
            sendfile, async I/O and vectored, scatter/gather writes to the network to avoid the costly aggregation of
            data and headers in a single buffer before writing to the network. <img src="../../images/pipeline.jpg"
            alt="" /> <a name="security" id="security"></a></p>
            <h2 class="section">Security</h2>
            <p>Most web servers have become more secure by a painful process of discovery. While it is no guarantee,
            developing a web server to be secure by design is easier than trying to engineer-in security after the
            fact. Securing embedded web servers is even more difficult, as it must be done without increasing memory
            footprint or degrading performance.</p><a name="mpr" id="mpr"></a>
            <h3>Embedthis Portable Runtime (MPR)</h3>
            <p>Appweb has been designed to be secure from the foundation up by using a Portable Runtime (MPR). The MPR
            is a cross-platform layer that permits over 97% of the Appweb code to be portable. It includes many
            mechanisms to assist in the creation of secure application. One such facility is a safe string and buffer
            handling module to help eliminate buffer overflows that have plagued many products.</p><a name="sandboxing"
            id="sandboxing"></a>
            <h3>Sandboxing</h3>
            <p>Appweb closely controls its use of system resources via a technique known as "sandboxing". This means
            running the web server within tightly controlled limits so that request errors will not compromise system
            operation. Appweb has also been hardened against several common denial of service attacks.</p>
            <p>Appweb can be configured to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preallocate memory and not grow beyond predefined memory limits</li>
                <li>Reject requests that are too large</li>
                <li>Reject URLs that are too long</li>
                <li>Run single-threaded or use a limited pool of reusable threads to service requests</li>
                <li>Be run by a designated user account or user group</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To build on this foundation, Appweb also provides a Secure Sockets Layer and Digest
            authentication.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a>
