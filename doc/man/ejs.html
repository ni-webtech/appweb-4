<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       The <B>ejs </B>command is an Ejscript command shell that can interpret and run
       JavaScript programs.

       Ejscript  is  an enhanced implementation of the JavaScript language for
       use in embedded applications such as web servers, embedded devices  and
       mobile  phones. It is especially well suited for Server-Side JavaScript
       web applications.

<B>INVOCATION</B>
       The <B>ejs </B>command can be used as a shell to interactively interpret  com-
       mands typed at the console or to run script files. When invoked with no
       files on the command line, <B>ejs </B>runs in interactive mode.   In  interac-
       tive  mode,  <B>ejs  </B>reads  input from the console and parses and executes
       script code as it is entered. In this mode, <B>ejs </B>command will read input
       until  it has a complete block of code and will then execute the block.
       The last result value computed will be echoed to the console. For exam-
       ple:

       ejs-0&gt if (true) {
       ejs-2&gt     print("Hello World");
       ejs-2&gt }
       Hello World

       ejs-0&gt

       Note:  the  input prompt includes a level of nest indicator starting at
       zero and increasing upward as commands nest. This is a hint as to  when
       you  have  closed sufficient braces for <B>ejs </B>to execute your command. As
       this is an internal compiler nest value, it  will  sometimes  increment
       more than 1 for each brace.

       If  <B>ejs </B>is invoked with a file name on the command line, that file will
       be read and its statements executed. One file may be supplied  and  the
       arguments after it will be passed into the script as command line argu-
       ments. For example:

               ejs myscript.es arg1 arg2 arg3

       The given file may be either a script file or it may  be  a  previously
       compiled Ejscript module with a <B>.mod </B>extension.

       If  you  require more script files to be parsed, use the --files "files
       ..." switch to supply extra scripts. These will be parsed in order, but
       after the primary script on the command line.

       The  <B>ejs  </B>command  can also invoke a specific static method on startup.
       If either the --class or --method switches are supplied, then <B>ejs  </B>will
       run  the requested static method after the input file script statements
       have been executed.

<B>COMPLIANCE</B>
       Ejscript is fully compliant with the JavaScript  (ECMA-262  3.X)  stan-
       dards,  but  it also offers a set of enhancements and fixes designed to
       improve the language and correct some  longstanding  JavaScript  design
       issues.  Use of these enhancements and fixes is optional and controlled
       via opt-in configuration switches and script pragmas.

       The <B>ec </B>compiler supports three language compliance modes:

           * <B>ecma  </B>for strict ECMAScript compliance.

           * <B>plus  </B>for close compliance plus compatible Ejscript enhancements.

           *  <B>fixed   </B>for  close compliance, plus compatible Ejscript enhance-
           ments and breaking fixes.

       When Ejscript is built, the default  compliance  mode  is  defined.  By
       default,  this  is  <B>plus  </B>mode.  The <B>fixed </B>mode corrects several issues
       with Javascript that remain in the language due to browser  compatibil-
       ity  requirements. Ejscript, by targeting non-browser environments, can
       rectify these issues  without  impact  to  legacy  applications.  These
       changes are:

           *  Assignments  to  non-existent  properties inside functions, will
           create local variables rather than global variables.

           * Multiple declarations of the same variable in the same scope  are
           not permitted.

           *  The  ==  and  != operators will perform like their more rigorous
           conterparts === and !===.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>--class className</B>
              Use the given className when searching for  the  startup  method
              specified via --method or "main" by default.

       <B>--cmd literalCommand</B>
              Evaluate a literal command string.

       <B>--debug</B>
              Run  in  debug  mode  and  generate symbolic stack backtraces if
              required.

       <B>--files "files ..."</B>
              Specifies an extra set of files to be compiled. The <B>ejs  </B>command
              normally  takes  just  one script file on the command line.  The
              --files switch allows extra script to be compiled after the pri-
              mary script, but before the scripts are run.

       <B>--log logName[:logLevel]</B>
              Specify  a file to log internal execution messages. Ejs will log
              execution related trace to the log file. The log level specifies
              the  desired  verbosity  of output. Level 0 is the least verbose
              and level 9 is the most. Level 2  will  include  trace  of  each
              source  statement  and  assembler instruction executed (provided
              --nodebug is not specifiec).

       <B>--lang [ecma|plus|fixed]</B>
              Set the language compliance mode. Use <B>ecma </B>for strict ECMAScript
              Edition  3  compliance. Use <B>plus </B>for close ECMAScript compliance
              plus Ejscript enhancements. Select  <B>fixed  </B>mode  for  ECMAScript
              features  plus  enhancements  and  some  compatibility  breaking
              fixes.

       <B>---method methodName</B>
              Set the startup method name. Defaults to "main" if a --className
              is specified and --method is not.

       <B>--nodebug</B>
              Run  the  script  without debug information. This will result in
              exceptions not having symbolic stack backtraces.

       <B>--optimize level</B>
              Set the code optimization level. Level values must be between  0
              (least) and 9 (most). Default is level 9.

       <B>--search ejsPath</B>
              Set  the  module search path. The module search path is a set of
              directories that the <B>ejs </B>command  will  use  when  locating  and
              loading Ejscript modules.  The search path will always have some
              system directories appended to  the  end.  These  include  paths
              specified  via  the  <B>EJSPATH </B>environment variable and key system
              directories such as the Ejscript system module directory and the
              directory containing the ejs command.

              The  search  path  value is similar in format to the system PATH
              variable format.  On windows, path segments are separated by ";"
              and on Linux, Unix, FreeBSD and MAC, the path segments are sepa-
              rated by ":" delimiters.

              Given a module named "a.b.c" in a script, <B>ejs </B>will use the  fol-
              lowing search strategy to locate the module:

              1. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod"

              2. Search for a module file named "a/b/c.mod"

              3. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod" in the search path

              4. Search for a module file named c.mod in the search path

       <B>--standard</B>
              Run scripts in standard  mode.  Ejscript  supports  two  parsing
              modes: strict and standard. Standard mode does not require vari-
              ables be declared and typed before use.

       <B>--stats</B>
              Print various statistics on exit.

       <B>--strict</B>
              Run scripts in standard  mode.  Ejscript  supports  two  parsing
              modes:  strict and standard. Strict mode requires that all vari-
              ables be declared and typed.

       <B>--use 'module, ...'</B>
              List of modules to preload before compiling input files.

       <B>--warn level</B>
              Set the compiler warning verbosity level. Level values  must  be
              between 0 (least verbose) and 9 (most). Default is 0.

       <B>--version</B>
              Print the <B>ejs </B>command version and exit.
