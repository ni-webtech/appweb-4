<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       The  <B>esp  </B>command generates, manages and runs ESP web applications.  It
       can generate ESP web applications, controllers,  database  tables,  and
       scaffolds.

       The  esp command will create directories and generate configuration and
       source code files that can then be manually edited as required.  Esp is
       intelligent  and  will  not overwrite existing files, so you can safely
       edit and regenerate without losing your changes. You can overwrite your
       changes if you wish to by using the <B>--overwrite </B>switch.

       Esp can run your application by invoking a configured web server.

<B>GENERATING APPLICATIONS</B>
       To  start  a  new  web  application,  run <B>esp </B>to create the application
       directory and generate  the  application  configuration  and  essential
       script files. For example:

             <B>esp generate app blog</B>

       This  will  will  create  a set of directories which have the following
       meaning:

             cache          - Cache directory for compiled content
             controllers    - Controller source
             db             - Databases and scripts
             db/migrations  - Databases migration modules
             layouts        - Web page layout files
             static         - Static web directory
             static/images  - Public images
             static/js      - Client side JavaScripts
             static/themes  - Application HTML themes
             views          - View source files

       Most of these directories are initially empty, but  may  be  used  over
       time.  ESP  follows  conventions  where specific files are stored. This
       greatly simplifies configuring a web application.

       Esp will also create some files which have the following meaning:

             appweb.config             - Appweb configuration file
             app.config                - Appweb configuration file
             esp-app.h                 - Application header file
             layouts/default.esp       - Default layout web page
             static/layout.css         - Default layout CSS file
             static/themes/default.css - Default theme CSS file
             static/js/jquery.js       - jQuery client side script

<B>GENERATING MIGRATIONS</B>
       Migrations are generated code modules that manage portions of the data-
       base.  Migrations  are used to create tables, initialize with test data
       and optionally destroy tables. Migrations are typically  generated  and
       then  hand-edited  to  include  relevant  initialization  or test data.
       Migrations are  useful  to  quickly  recreate  the  database  with  the
       required tables and data.

             <B>esp generate migration DESCRIPTION TABLE [field:type ...]</B>

       The  DESCRIPTION  is used to name the migration which is created in the
       <B>db/migrations </B>directory. A migration is given a unique ordered sequence
       number  and the description is appended to this number. The description
       is mapped where spaces are changed to "_" characters.  When  migrations
       are run, they are run in sequence number order.

       If  field:type values are supplied, the database migration will include
       code to create a column for each specified field of the requested type.
       The  valid  database  types  are:  blob, boolean, date, float, integer,
       string, and text.

<B>GENERATING TABLES</B>
       To generate a database table without creating a migration:

             <B>esp generate table TABLE [field:type ...]</B>

<B>GENERATING CONTROLLERS</B>
       Controllers  are  the  primary  mechanism  for  responding  to   client
       requests. To generate a controller, run:

             <B>esp generate controller NAME [actions...]</B>

       This  will  create a controller of the requested name. It will create a
       controller source file in the <B>controllers </B>directory.  If  action  names
       are  requested,  the controller source will define an action method for
       each name. If not action names are requested, esp will define a default
       action  named  <B>index</B>.   You can edit the controller source to meet your
       needs.

<B>GENERATING SCAFFOLDS</B>
       A scaffold is a generated controller, database migration,  and  set  of
       views  that  provides add, edit and list functionality for the database
       table.  Scaffolds are useful to quickly generate chunks of the applica-
       tion and prototype web pages and actions for managing a database table.
       To generate a scaffold:

             <B>esp generate scaffold TABLE [field:type ...]</B>

       This will create a scaffold for the specified database table  and  will
       generate a controller of the same name.

       If field:type values are supplied, a database migration will be created
       with code to create a column for each specified field of the  requested
       type.  The  valid database types are: blob, boolean, date, float, inte-
       ger, string, and text. The migration will use  the  name  "create_scaf-
       fold_TABLE" and will be created under the <B>db/migrations </B>direcvtory.

       The  scaffold  will  include an edit action and view page that provides
       add and edit capability. The list action and view, provides the ability
       to list the table rows and select an entry to edit.

<B>COMPILING</B>
       Esp  compiles  controllers  and ESP pages native code shared libraries.
       These are then loaded and run by ESP in  response  to  incoming  client
       requests.  Code is compiled only once but can be run many times to ser-
       vice incoming requests.

       In development mode, ESP will automatically compile the  relevant  por-
       tions  of the application if the source code is modified. It can intel-
       ligently recompile controllers and ESP pages.  However,  you  can  also
       explicilty recompile portions or the complete appliction.

       Esp can recompile everything via:

             <B>esp compile ...</B>.

       This will re-compile each controller and ESP page.

       Esp  also  provides options for you to individually compile controllers
       and ESP pages. To recompile named pages or controllers:

             <B>esp compile path/*.esp...</B>.

             <B>esp compile controller NAMES...</B>.

       To compile the entire application and produce a single  shared  library
       file:

             <B>esp --flat compile </B>.

<B>RUNNING</B>
       To run your application:

             <B>esp run</B>

<B>CLEANING</B>
       To clean all generated module files:
             <B>esp clean</B>

<B>MIGRATIONS</B>
       Migration  files  can be run via the <B>esp migrate </B>command. With no other
       parameters, the command will run all migrations that have not yet  been
       applied  to the database. You can also use <B>esp migrate forward </B>to apply
       apply the next unapplied migration. Similarly <B>esp migrate backward </B>will
       reverse the last applied migration. You can also use <B>esp migrate NNN </B>to
       migrate forward or backward to a specific migration, where NNN  is  the
       migration sequence number at the start of the migration file name.

<B>COMMANDS</B>
       esp has the following command usage patterns:

             esp clean
             esp compile
             esp compile controller name
             esp compile path/*.esp
             esp generate app name
             esp generate controller name [action [, action] ...]
             esp generate scaffold model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp generate table name model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp run

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>--chdir dir</B>
             Change the current working directory before beginning processing.

       <B>--config configFile</B>
             Use the specified config file instead of appweb.conf

       <B>--database Database provider</B>
             Use the specified database provider. Set to "mdb" or "sqlite".

       <B>--flat</B>
             Compile the application flat into a single shared library file.

       <B>--keep</B>
             Keep intermediate source files in the cache directory. This over-
             rides the EspKeepSource setting in the appweb.conf file.

       <B>--listen [ip:]port</B>
             Define  the  listening  endpoint  address. This will be used when
             generating an application. The value will  be  patched  into  the
             generated appweb.conf configuration file.

       <B>--log logFile:level</B>
             Specify  a  file  to  log  messages.   The syntax is: <B>"--log log-</B>
             <B>Name[,moduleName][:logLevel]"</B>.  Level 3 will  trace  the  request
             and response headers.

       <B>--overwrite</B>
             Overwrite  existing  files.  Ejsweb  normally  will not overwrite
             existing files. This is to preserve user  changes  to  previously
             generated files.

       <B>--quiet</B>
             Suppress diagnostic trace to the console.

       <B>--platform os-arch-profile</B>
             Target platform configuration to build for.

       <B>--rebuild</B>
             Force  a  recompile  of all items when used with the compile com-
             mand.  When used with migrate, this will  recreate  the  database
             and apply all migrations.

       <B>--reverse</B>
             Reverse the application of migrations.

       <B>--routeName name</B>
             This  selects  the Appweb route by name that will be used for the
             ESP configuration. The ESP directory names, and compilation  com-
             mands  are  determined  by  the  ESP configuration drawn from the
             specified route. The default is the first route with the ESP han-
             dler defined in appweb.conf.

       <B>--routePrefix prefix</B>
             This selects the Appweb route by prefix that will be used for the
             ESP configuration. The ESP directory names, and compilation  com-
             mands  are  determined  by  the  ESP configuration drawn from the
             specified route. The default is the first route with the ESP han-
             dler defined in appweb.conf.

       <B>--verbose </B>or <B>-v</B>
             Run in verbose mode and trace actions to the console.

       <B>--why </B>or <B>-w</B>
             Explain why a resource was or was not compiled.
