#   appweb.conf -- Single file (flat) Appweb Configuration
#   
#   This configuration file controls the operation of the Appweb server. The 
#   order of configuration directives matters as this file is parsed only once.
#   You must put the server root and error log definitions first to ensure 
#   configuration errors are logged.
#
#   This file does not use include directives so simplify setup.
#

#
#   Define the logging configuration first so any errors are logged
#   Log all Appweb errors and trace to this file. This is the error 
#   file for the whole server including all virtual hosts. 
#
ErrorLog stdout

#
#   The log level can be a number between 0 and 9 (most verbose level).
#
LogLevel 3

#
#   Enable the tracing of request and response requests.
#   The LogTrace directive defines a level at which to log requests and describes 
#   whether to trace requests, responses and/or headers and content body data.
#   The default is to log headers and response headers only at level 3
#
#   LogTrace 2 headers,body,request,response,time

#   The LogTraceFilter defines a maximum size to log for a file and an optional 
#   inclusion and exclusion pattern. File extensions matching the inclusion (first) 
#   pattern are traced. File extensions matching the exclusion (second) pattern are 
#   excluded.
#
#   LogTraceFilter 4096 "*" "gif,jpg,png,ico"

#   Bind Appweb to listen for incoming requests on this address. Formats 
#   include (IP, IP:PORT, PORT). If an IP address is omitted, Appweb will 
#   listen on all interfaces. If a port is omitted, then port 80 is used.
#   Use [::]:port for IPv6 to bind to all addresses. [::1] is the IPv6 loopback.

#   Name of the server to use for redirects and error responses to clients.

#   Search path for dynamically loadable modules. If modules have been 
#   statically linked into Appweb, this directive and LoadModule directives
#   will be ignored. This directive must be before any LoadModule directives.

#
#   Notes on the request processing pipeline. The pipeline consists of a set 
#   of stages comprised of a handler, possible filters and one network 
#   connector. 
#
#   The request processing pipeline can be configured at various levels: 
#   globally, virtual hosts and location blocks. At each level, a set of 
#   processing stages can be defined. Inner levels inherit the pipeline from 
#   the outer levels. The pipeline can be reset at a level by using 
#   ResetPipeline. Each stage may be defined for all requests or only for a 
#   specific file extension or location path prefix.
#
#   The pipeline is defined with the network connector first and the handler 
#   last. If you use the AddConnector, AddFilter or AddHandler directives, the 
#   stage is defined for both input and output processing. For filters you can
#   use AddInputFilter AddOutputFilter directives to define for a single 
#   direction.
#
#   Define the network connector first. This must be before all handlers and 
#   filters. The network connector will transparently use the send connector 
#   for static file data.
#
#   Multiple handlers can be defined, but only the first matching handler will
#   be activated when a request is processed.
