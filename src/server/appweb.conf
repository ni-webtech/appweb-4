#
#   appweb.conf -- Default Configuration for the Embedthis Appweb HTTP Server
#   
#   This configuration file controls the operation of the Appweb server. The 
#   order of configuration directives matters as this file is parsed only once.
#   You must put the server root and error log definitions first to ensure 
#   configuration errors are logged.
#

#
#   Define the logging configuration first so any errors are logged
#
include conf/log.conf

#
#   Root directory for Appweb to find necessary files and libraries. 
#   Appweb will change directory to this location when it runs.
#
ServerRoot "."

#
#   Create a "chroot jail" by changing the system root directory to this directory. 
#   Once changed files outside the jail will be inaccessible.
#
#   Chroot "."

#
#   Bind Appweb to listen for incoming requests on this address. Formats 
#   include (IP, IP:PORT, PORT). If an IP address is omitted, Appweb will 
#   listen on all interfaces. If a port is omitted, then port 80 is used.
#   Use [::]:port for IPv6 to bind to all addresses. [::1] is the IPv6 loopback.
#
Listen 7777

#
#   Name of the server to use for redirects and error responses to clients. 
#   Uncomment this line and replace it with the public name of your server. 
#   This host name and port do not get used for listening on sockets. If 
#   unspecified, Appweb will use the IP address for the host name.
#
#   ServerName http://localhost:9997

#
#   Location for documents for the primary server host. Virtual hosts 
#   may define their own DocumentRoot directives.
#
DocumentRoot "./web"

#
#   Default directory index to serve when a directory is requested.
#
DirectoryIndex index.html

#
#   Location of the mime translation file to map content types to file 
#   extensions. For other types, you can use AddType.  
#   "AddType application/x-appweb-other other"
#
TypesConfig mime.types

#
#   Search path for dynamically loadable modules. If modules have been 
#   statically linked into Appweb, this directive and LoadModule directives
#   will be ignored. This directive must be before any LoadModule directives.
#
LoadModulePath "../../out/modules"

#
#   Notes on the request processing pipeline. The pipeline consists of a set 
#   of stages comprised of a handler, possible filters and one network 
#   connector. 
#
#   The request processing pipeline can be configured at various levels: 
#   globally, virtual hosts and location blocks. At each level, a set of 
#   processing stages can be defined. Inner levels inherit the pipeline from 
#   the outer levels. The pipeline can be reset at a level by using 
#   ResetPipeline. Each stage may be defined for all requests or only for a 
#   specific file extension or location path prefix.
#
#   If you use the AddConnector, AddFilter or AddHandler directives, the 
#   stage is defined for both input and output processing. For filters you can
#   use AddInputFilter AddOutputFilter directives to define for a single 
#   direction.
#
#   Multiple handlers can be defined, but only the first matching handler will
#   be activated when a request is processed.
#
SetConnector netConnector
AddOutputFilter authFilter
AddOutputFilter rangeFilter
AddFilter chunkFilter
#   AddInputFilter uploadFilter

#
#   Include all other modules before the file module which is the catch-all.
#
Include conf/modules/*

#
#   The file handler supports requests for static files. Put this last after
#   all other modules and it becomes the catch-all due to the empty quotes.

#   The user name and group to switch to once Appweb has started.

#
#   Sample authorization directives
#
#
#   Authorization directives for basic or digest authentication. You can
#   add these here to apply to the entire server or put inside a 
#   VirutalHost, Directory or Location block. If defined at multiple
#   levels, the inner most level wins. example:
#
#       AuthMethod file 
#       AuthGroupFile groups.db
#       AuthUserFile users.db
#       AuthDigestQop auth
#
#       <Directory $DOCUMENT_ROOT/basic/acme>
#           AuthType basic
#           AuthName "Acme Inc"
#           Require valid-user
#       </Directory>
#
#       <Directory $DOCUMENT_ROOT/digest/acme>
#           AuthType digest
#           AuthName "Acme Inc"
#           Require valid-user
#       </Directory>
#

#
#   Include all configuration files. The only wildcard supported is "*". Don't use with extensions, e.g. (*.conf).
#   Order matters here. Wan't to load extension modules first, then configure virtual hosts and lastly apps.
#
Include conf/doc.conf
Include conf/hosts/*
Include conf/apps/*

#
#   Include the tunable and miscellaneous parameters
#
