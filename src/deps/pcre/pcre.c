/* On Unix-like systems config.h.in is converted by "configure" into config.h.
Some other environments also support the use of "configure". PCRE is written in
Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it can cope with, allowing
it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" systems.

If you are going to build PCRE "by hand" on a system without "configure" you
should copy the distributed config.h.generic to config.h, and then set up the
macro definitions the way you need them. You must then add -DHAVE_CONFIG_H to
all of your compile commands, so that config.h is included at the start of
every source.

Alternatively, you can avoid editing by using -D on the compiler command line
to set the macro values. In this case, you do not have to set -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.

PCRE uses memmove() if HAVE_MEMMOVE is set to 1; otherwise it uses bcopy() if
HAVE_BCOPY is set to 1. If your system has neither bcopy() nor memmove(), set
them both to 0; an emulation function will be used. */

/* When compiling a DLL for Windows, the exported symbols have to be declared
using some MS magic. I found some useful information on this web page:
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y4h7bcy6(VS.80).aspx. According to the
information there, using __declspec(dllexport) without "extern" we have a
definition; with "extern" we have a declaration. The settings here override the
setting in pcre.h (which is included below); it defines only PCRE_EXP_DECL,
which is all that is needed for applications (they just import the symbols). We
use:

  PCRE_EXP_DECL       for declarations
  PCRE_EXP_DEFN       for definitions of exported functions
  PCRE_EXP_DATA_DEFN  for definitions of exported variables

The reason for the two DEFN macros is that in non-Windows environments, one
does not want to have "extern" before variable definitions because it leads to
compiler warnings. So we distinguish between functions and variables. In
Windows, the two should always be the same.

The reason for wrapping this in #ifndef PCRE_EXP_DECL is so that pcretest,
which is an application, but needs to import this file in order to "peek" at
internals, can #include pcre.h first to get an application's-eye view.

In principle, people compiling for non-Windows, non-Unix-like (i.e. uncommon,
special-purpose environments) might want to stick other stuff in front of
exported symbols. That's why, in the non-Windows case, we set PCRE_EXP_DEFN and
PCRE_EXP_DATA_DEFN only if they are not already set. */

regex. The lengths are used when searching for specific things, and also in the
debugging printing of a compiled regex. We use a macro so that it can be
defined close to the definitions of the opcodes themselves.

As things have been extended, some of these are no longer fixed lenths, but are
minima instead. For example, the length of a single-character repeat may vary
in UTF-8 mode. The code that uses this table must know about such things. */

then run on another where the size of pointers is different, all might still
be well. For the case of compiled-on-4 and run-on-8, we include an extra
pointer that is always NULL. For future-proofing, a few dummy fields were
originally included - even though you can never get this planning right - but
there is only one left now.

NOTE NOTE NOTE:
Because people can now save and re-use compiled patterns, any additions to this
structure should be made at the end, and something earlier (e.g. a new
flag in the options or one of the dummy fields) should indicate that the new
fields are present. Currently PCRE always sets the dummy fields to zero.

/* The data consists of a vector of structures of type cnode. The two unsigned
32-bit integers are used as follows:

(f0) (1) The most significant byte holds the script number. The numbers are
         defined by the enum in ucp.h.

     (2) The 0x00800000 bit is set if this entry defines a range of characters.
         It is not set if this entry defines a single character

     (3) The 0x00600000 bits are spare.

     (4) The 0x001fffff bits contain the code point. No Unicode code point will
         ever be greater than 0x0010ffff, so this should be OK for ever.

(f1) (1) The 0xfc000000 bits contain the character type number. The numbers are
         defined by an enum in ucp.h.

     (2) The 0x03ff0000 bits are spare.

     (3) The 0x0000ffff bits contain EITHER the unsigned offset to the top of
         range if this entry defines a range, OR the *signed* offset to the
         character's "other case" partner if this entry defines a single
         character. There is no partner if the value is zero.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| script (8) |.|.|.| codepoint (21) || type (6) |.|.| spare (8) | offset (16) |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              | | |                              | |

              |
              |-> range flag

The upper/lower casing information is set only for characters that come in
pairs. The non-one-to-one mappings in the Unicode data are ignored.

When searching the data, proceed as follows:

(1) Set up for a binary chop search.

(2) If the top is not greater than the bottom, the character is not in the
    table. Its type must therefore be "Cn" ("Undefined").

(3) Find the middle vector element.

(4) Extract the code point and compare. If equal, we are done.

(5) If the test character is smaller, set the top to the current point, and
    goto (2).

(6) If the current entry defines a range, compute the last character by adding
    the offset, and see if the test character is within the range. If it is,
    we are done.

(7) Otherwise, set the bottom to one element past the current point and goto
    (2).

/* This file contains character tables that are used when no external tables
are passed to PCRE by the application that calls it. The tables are used only
for characters whose code values are less than 256.

This is a default version of the tables that assumes ASCII encoding. A program
called dftables (which is distributed with PCRE) can be used to build
alternative versions of this file. This is necessary if you are running in an
EBCDIC environment, or if you want to default to a different encoding, for
example ISO-8859-1. When dftables is run, it creates these tables in the
current locale. If PCRE is configured with --enable-rebuild-chartables, this
happens automatically.

The following #includes are present because without the gcc 4.x may remove the
array definition from the final binary if PCRE is built into a static library
and dead code stripping is activated. This leads to link errors. Pulling in the
header ensures that the array gets flagged as "someone outside this compilation
unit might reference this" and so it will always be supplied to the linker. */

first pre-compile phase that determines how much memory is required. The regex
is partly compiled into this space, but the compiled parts are discarded as
soon as they can be, so that hopefully there will never be an overrun. The code
does, however, check for an overrun. The largest amount I've seen used is 218,
so this number is very generous.

The same workspace is used during the second, actual compile phase for
remembering forward references to groups so that they can be filled in at the
end. Each entry in this list occupies LINK_SIZE bytes, so even when LINK_SIZE
is 4 there is plenty of room. */

the number of relocations needed when a shared library is loaded dynamically,
it is now one long string. We cannot use a table of offsets, because the
lengths of inserts such as XSTRING(MAX_NAME_SIZE) are not known. Instead, we
simply count through to the one we want - this isn't a performance issue
because these strings are used only when there is a compilation error. */

/* Table to identify digits and hex digits. This is used when compiling
patterns. Note that the tables in chartables are dependent on the locale, and
may mark arbitrary characters as digits - but the PCRE compiling code expects
to handle only 0-9, a-z, and A-Z as digits when compiling. That is why we have
a private table here. It costs 256 bytes, but it is a lot faster than doing
character value tests (at least in some simple cases I timed), and in some
applications one wants PCRE to compile efficiently as well as match
efficiently.

For convenience, we use the same bit definitions as in chartables:

  0x04   decimal digit
  0x08   hexadecimal digit

Then we can use ctype_digit and ctype_xdigit in the code. */

    the way Perl works seems to be as follows:

    Outside a character class, the digits are read as a decimal number. If the
    number is less than 10, or if there are that many previous extracting
    left brackets, then it is a back reference. Otherwise, up to three octal
    digits are read to form an escaped byte. Thus \123 is likely to be octal
    123 (cf \0123, which is octal 012 followed by the literal 3). If the octal
    value is greater than 377, the least significant 8 bits are taken. Inside a

Originally, this function only recognized a sequence of letters between the
terminators, but it seems that Perl recognizes any sequence of characters,
though of course unknown POSIX names are subsequently rejected. Perl gives an
"Unknown POSIX class" error for [:f\oo:] for example, where previously PCRE
didn't consider this to be a POSIX class. Likewise for [:1234:].

The problem in trying to be exactly like Perl is in the handling of escapes. We
have to be sure that [abc[:x\]pqr] is *not* treated as containing a POSIX
class, but [abc[:x\]pqr:]] is (so that an error can be generated). The code
below handles the special case of \], but does not try to do any other escape
processing. This makes it different from Perl for cases such as [:l\ower:]
where Perl recognizes it as the POSIX class "lower" but PCRE does not recognize
"l\ower". This is a lesser evil that not diagnosing bad classes when Perl does,
I think.

earlier groups that are outside the current group). However, when a group is
optional (i.e. the minimum quantifier is zero), OP_BRAZERO or OP_SKIPZERO is
inserted before it, after it has been compiled. This means that any OP_RECURSE
items within it that refer to the group itself or any contained groups have to
have their offsets adjusted. That one of the jobs of this function. Before it
is called, the partially compiled regex must be temporarily terminated with

This function has been extended with the possibility of forward references for
recursions and subroutine calls. It must also check the list of such references

the current group is on this list, it adjusts the offset in the list, not the

alternative branch. If they all start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC, or with a bracket
all of whose alternatives start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC (recurse ad lib), then
it's anchored. However, if this is a multiline pattern, then only OP_SOD
counts, since OP_CIRC can match in the middle.

We can also consider a regex to be anchored if OP_SOM starts all its branches.
This is the code for \G, which means "match at start of match position, taking
into account the match offset".

A branch is also implicitly anchored if it starts with .* and DOTALL is set,
because that will try the rest of the pattern at all possible matching points,
so there is no point trying again.... er ....

.... except when the .* appears inside capturing parentheses, and there is a
subsequent back reference to those parentheses. We haven't enough information
to catch that case precisely.

At first, the best we could do was to detect when .* was in capturing brackets
and the highest back reference was greater than or equal to that level.
However, by keeping a bitmap of the first 31 back references, we can catch some
of the more common cases more precisely.

                   RECURSION IN THE match() FUNCTION

The match() function is highly recursive, though not every recursive call
increases the recursive depth. Nevertheless, some regular expressions can cause
it to recurse to a great depth. I was writing for Unix, so I just let it call
itself recursively. This uses the stack for saving everything that has to be
saved for a recursive call. On Unix, the stack can be large, and this works
fine.

It turns out that on some non-Unix-like systems there are problems with
programs that use a lot of stack. (This despite the fact that every last chip
has oodles of memory these days, and techniques for extending the stack have
been known for decades.) So....

There is a fudge, triggered by defining NO_RECURSE, which avoids recursive
calls by keeping local variables that need to be preserved in blocks of memory
obtained from malloc() instead instead of on the stack. Macros are used to
achieve this so that the actual code doesn't look very different to what it
always used to.

The original heap-recursive code used longjmp(). However, it seems that this
can be very slow on some operating systems. Following a suggestion from Stan
Switzer, the use of longjmp() has been abolished, at the cost of having to
provide a unique number for each call to RMATCH. There is no way of generating
a sequence of numbers at compile time in C. I have given them names, to make
them stand out more clearly.

Crude tests on x86 Linux show a small speedup of around 5-8%. However, on
FreeBSD, avoiding longjmp() more than halves the time taken to run the standard
tests. Furthermore, not using longjmp() means that local dynamic variables
don't have indeterminate values; this has meant that the frame size can be
reduced because the result can be "passed back" by straight setting of the
variable instead of being passed in the frame.

Performance note: It might be tempting to extract commonly used fields from the

performance. Tests using gcc on a SPARC disproved this; in the first case, it
made performance worse.

Arguments:

   ecode       pointer to current position in compiled code
   mstart      pointer to the current match start position (can be modified
                 by encountering \K)
   offset_top  current top pointer
   md          pointer to "static" info for the match
   ims         current /i, /m, and /s options
   eptrb       pointer to chain of blocks containing eptr at start of
                 brackets - for testing for empty matches
   flags       can contain
                 match_condassert - this is an assertion condition

/* This function applies a compiled re to a subject string and picks out
portions of the string if it matches. Two elements in the vector are set for
each substring: the offsets to the start and end of the substring.

Arguments:
  argument_re     points to the compiled expression
  extra_data      points to extra data or is NULL
  subject         points to the subject string
  length          length of subject string (may contain binary zeros)
  start_offset    where to start in the subject string
  options         option bits
  offsets         points to a vector of ints to be filled in with offsets
  offsetcount     the number of elements in the vector

Returns:          > 0 => success; value is the number of elements filled in
                  = 0 => success, but offsets is not big enough
                   -1 => failed to match
                 < -1 => some kind of unexpected problem

/* This function is called (optionally) at the start of compile or match, to
validate that a supposed UTF-8 string is actually valid. The early check means
that subsequent code can assume it is dealing with a valid string. The check
can be turned off for maximum performance, but the consequences of supplying
an invalid string are then undefined.

Originally, this function checked according to RFC 2279, allowing for values in
the range 0 to 0x7fffffff, up to 6 bytes long, but ensuring that they were in
the canonical format. Once somebody had pointed out RFC 3629 to me (it
obsoletes 2279), additional restrictions were applied. The values are now
limited to be between 0 and 0x0010ffff, no more than 4 bytes long, and the
subrange 0xd000 to 0xdfff is excluded.

Arguments:
  string       points to the string
  length       length of string, or -1 if the string is zero-terminated
